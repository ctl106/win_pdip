                      HOW TO LAUNCH THE REGRESSION TESTS
                      ==================================

The regression tests are based on CHECK library. The latter must be installed
prior to launch the tests.

1/ THE WHOLE SOFTWARE
   -------------------

- To trigger all the regression tests:

$ cd <top directory of PDIP sources>
$ make clean (if a build as been done)
$ cmake .  (the following must be displayed if CHECK is installed)
[...]
-- Found CHECK: /usr/local/lib/libcheck.so
[...]
$ make
$ test/check_all
[...]
100%: Checks: 47, Failures: 0, Errors: 0


2/ PDIP library
   ------------

- To trigger the regression tests of PDIP:

$ cd <top directory of PDIP sources>
$ make clean (if a build as been done)
$ cmake .  (the following must be displayed if CHECK is installed)
[...]
-- Found CHECK: /usr/local/lib/libcheck.so
[...]
$ make
$ test/check_pdip
[...]
100%: Checks: 37, Failures: 0, Errors: 0



3/ ISYS library
   ------------

- To trigger the regression tests of ISYS:

$ cd <top directory of PDIP sources>
$ make clean (if a build as been done)
$ cmake .  (the following must be displayed if CHECK is installed)
[...]
-- Found CHECK: /usr/local/lib/libcheck.so
[...]
$ make
$ test/check_isys
[...]
100%: Checks: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0


4/ RSYS library
   ------------

- To trigger the regression tests of RSYS:

$ cd <top directory of PDIP sources>
$ make clean (if a build as been done)
$ cmake .  (the following must be displayed if CHECK is installed)
[...]
-- Found CHECK: /usr/local/lib/libcheck.so
[...]
$ make
$ test/check_rsys
[...]
100%: Checks: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0
