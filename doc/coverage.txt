$ cmake -DCMAKE_COVERAGE=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
$ make
$ make pdip_coverage

Then, open ./pdip_coverage/index.html in your browser to view the coverage report.

2/ ISYS library

- To trigger test coverage measurement mode:

$ cd <top directory of PDIP sources>
$ make clean (if a build as been done)
$ cmake -DCMAKE_COVERAGE=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
$ make
$ make isys_coverage

Then, open ./isys_coverage/index.html in your browser to view the coverage report.


- To go back in design mode:
