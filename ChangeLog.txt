Version 2.4.5 (14-Jun-2018)
=============

     . CMakeLists.txt
       isys/CMakeLists.txt
       rsys/CMakeLists.txt
         . Use of "INCLUDE(GNUInstallDirs)" to get the standard variables
           for installation directories


Version 2.4.4 (29-May-2018)
=============

     . pdip_lib.c: Fixed a compilation error because on some machines, regoff_t
                   may be "int" (ubuntu Linux) or "long int" (Alpine Linux)
     . Transfered FindIsys/Rsys.cmake respectively in isys/rsys sub-directories
     . pdip_install.sh:
          . Packaging/Installation of Find/Isys/Rsys.cmake
     . ISYS
         . isys_deb.postinst: Added access right management for FindIsys.cmake
     . RSYS
         . rsys_deb.postinst: Added access right management for FindRsys.cmake
         . rsystemd.c: Inclusion of <string.h> was missing for memset()


Version 2.4.3 (03-May-2018)
=============

     . Test suite:
         . Suppressed the useless surrounding braces in unit tests
           as START_TEST/END_TEST macros respectively include the
           opening/closing braces
         . Replaced fork() by check_fork() for robustness as the latter
           put the child process in the process group of the unit test process
           ==> This facilitates its termination in case of failure
     . doc/index.html:
         . Fixed broken link for the reference to EXPECT tool
         . Added a reference to ISYS and RSYS as examples of applications using
           PDIP library
     . pdip_install.sh:
         . Added pdip/rsys/isys library respectively in pdip.pc/isys.pc/rsys.pc
           as the dependency mechanism (i.e. "Requires" field) makes
           pkg-config retrieve all the needed libraries

           e.g. $ pkg-config --libs pdip
                -lpdip -lpthread
                $ pkg-config --libs isys
                -lisys -lpdip -lpthread
                $ pkg-config --libs rsys
                -lrsys -lpdip -lpthread

     . test/CMakeLists.txt
         . Added double quotes around PKG_CONFIG variables to get a correct
           display of the libraries when cmake is configuring



Version 2.4.2 (10-Apr-2018)
=============

     . Moved all build files concerning ISYS and RSYS into their respective

               . Avoid dynamic allocation in isystem()/rsystem() services when
                 the command line is short (< 256 chars for ISYS and 4096 for RSYS)
               . No longer ignore SIGINT/SIGQUIT in the shell as system() ignores
                 those signals in the father process while running the command
                 (the default disposition is restablished at the end of the command)
                 ==> We don't manage those signals even in isystem() code as this
                     is not adapted to multithreaded applications
               . Updated the test suite accordingly



Version 2.4.0 (02-Apr-2018)
=============

     . PDIP: . Redesigned the process termination to make it

             . Updated the on line manuals as well as doc/index.html for
               pdip_configure() API
     . TESTS: . Simplification of the test suite (only one suite instead of
                multiple suites per sub-element: PDIP, RSYS and ISYS)
              . Global executable to launch all the tests: test/check_all
              . Added robustness in the procedure killing/waiting rsystemd
                server termination
              . Take in account EINTR when invoking waitpid()
              . Added global test coverage (cf. doc/coverage.txt)
              . Increased test coverage
     . RSYS: Made sure that exit code of RSYSTEMD is 2 upon signal receipt
     . ISYS: . Configure PDIP library with external SIGCHLD signal handler
               (pdip_configure(1, 0))
             . PDIP cleanup at library unloading
 


Version 2.3.3 (26-Mar-2018)

       FindRsys.cmake
       FindPdip.cmake: New files to help the build of cmake based packages using PDIP,
                       ISYS and RSYS
     . Updated doc/system_optimization* to present the preceding files
     . test/tisys.c
       test/trsys.c: Change pathname of "isys.h" and "rsys.h" to make the
                     test compile in a virgin system where ISYS and RSYS are
                     not installed


Version 2.3.2 (22-Mar-2018)
=============

     . Added doc/regression.txt to present the regression tests

     . PDIP, ISYS, RSYS:
         . Increased test coverage
         . Moved tisys.c and trsys.c in test directory

       ==> Added isys_lib_initialize() and pdip_lib_initialize() services
       to be called in a child process if one need to use those services in
       the childs
     . Use local header files in test sources files (e.g. "../pdip.h") instead
       of installed ones in case the package is not installed yet on the target
     . Added GCC format attribute to pdip_send(), isystem() and rsystem()
       to detect format errors at compilation time
     . Bug fix: The value of the status returned by isystem()/rsystem()
                reflects the Linux rules after a better
                understanding of the content of $? shell variable
     . PDIP:
        . Increased test code coverage for pdip_util.c
          (total for PDIP is 83.4% lines covered as more error branches
          difficult to enter in are added with new APIs)
     . ISYS:
         . Added PDIP_FLAG_RECV_ON_THE_FLOW in the configuration of the PDIP
           object to receive the data on the flow from verbose applications
           ==> This saves dynamic memory
         . Added test coverage (~70.4 % lines covered, uncovered lines are
           error branches difficult to enter in)

           affinity for rsystemd
     . Updated the documents in doc/*

      . PDIP_LIB:
         . Secured the killing of the controlled process to avoid to
           trigger a kill(-1, SIGTERM/KILL)
         . Some small fixes revealed by the test coverage measurement
     . Added unitary tests based on CHECK package
     . Added code coverage measurement based on GCOV/LCOV (cf. doc/coverage.txt)

               one shot)
             . Added buf_resize_increment field
          . Bug fix and redesign of pdip_recv():
             . When a timeout is passed, suppressed the internal read
               reiterations: any read data is immediately returned to the user.
             . If PDIP_RECV_ERROR is returned, there are no longer received
               data in the buffers
             . If there are outstanding data, they returned immediately if
               a read request without regex is invoked
          . Bug fix in pdip_flush_internal(): the computation of the data
            to flush was completely wrong !!!

       . Added an API with libpdip.so along with its header file (pdip.h),
         online manual (pdip.3) and test directory
         ==> The pattern matching is faster as it is done on multiple lines
             in one shot instead of line by line (as it is done in pdip tool)
